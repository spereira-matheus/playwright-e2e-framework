## Testing Strategy

### What is covered
- Critical user journeys
- Happy path and negative scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Regression scenarios for high-risk areas

### What is intentionally avoided
- Low-value UI checks
- Redundant validations already covered by API tests

This approach ensures fast feedback and meaningful coverage.

---

## Risk-Based Testing Approach

Test scenarios are selected based on:
- Business impact
- Frequency of use
- Historical defect patterns
- Complexity and integration points

High-risk areas receive deeper coverage, while low-risk areas are validated through lighter checks.
